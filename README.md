# pytracks

Procedures for measuring and counting fission tracks in minerals are time-consuming and involve practical problems, such as the observer efficiency.

This is pytracks, a package based on numpy, scipy, scikit-image and other packages, that is capable of counting these tracks automatically.

This is an alpha version, and it ~~is~~ — was supposed to be :joy: — under heavy development. Thank you for pointing suggestions and reporting bugs.
