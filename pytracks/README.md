# pytracks

Procedures for measuring and counting fission tracks in minerals are time-consuming and involve practical problems.

This is pytracks, a package based on numpy, scipy, scikit-image and other packages, that is capable of counting these tracks automatically.

This is an alpha version, and it is under heavy development. Thank you for pointing suggestions and reporting bugs.
